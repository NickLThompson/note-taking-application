## Description

This program is designed to efficiently take notes and keep them

saved in the same website. It saves the notes and you can close the

website and re-open it and the notes will still be there. It is very

simple and easy to use and easy to read. 


## Usage

The usage of this program is to be able to write and save notes quickly

and efficiently. It will save your notes if you happen to close it or 

if you want to save it for later the notes stay.

## Status

The status of this program is a good success. My classmates were able to

help me where I needed it and I got this done in a decent amount of time. 

I'm pretty proud of how quickly I got this homework done, even though it

was objectively a pretty easy homework. Much easier than the last one; 

However, I wasn't able to get the delete button to work.
